Project 1

The first project goal is to implement, in C, a function "encode" (codifica), 
that prints in binary the content of a data structure. The data structure is 
in the format of the encoding used by the mecanism Protol Buffers. 

Project 2

The second project implements a function in C that receives as a parameter a function
f and the description of the group of parameters and returns a "new version" of f, that is 
dynamically generated and when called it calls the original function.
